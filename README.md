# **NSA (Network Security Assistant) Toolkit**

**Creator:** Yousuf Alkhanjari

A powerful, all-in-one, menu-driven Bash script designed to manage and enhance the defensive security and privacy of a Linux system.

### **Philosophy**

The NSA Toolkit was created to bridge the gap between powerful, complex command-line security tools and the everyday user. Security should be accessible to everyone. This script takes a suite of best-in-class open-source security software and centralizes them into a single, user-friendly interface that empowers users to take control of their system's defense.

### **What It Is For**

This toolkit is designed for any Linux user who wants to:

* **Harden** their system against common threats.  
* **Protect** their privacy on untrusted networks.  
* **Monitor** their system for suspicious activity.  
* **Automate** routine security checks and receive alerts.  
* **Manage** users, firewalls, and data security from one place.  
* **Learn** more about their system's security posture.

### **Key Features**

The toolkit is organized into several powerful modules:

#### **üõ°Ô∏è Proactive Defense & Hardening**

* **Firewall Management:** Easy-to-use interface for UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) to set rules, enable/disable, and block threats.  
* **Antivirus Management:** Integrates ClamAV for on-demand file scanning and deep system scans.  
* **Automated Security Bot:** A cron-based bot that runs hourly checks for new malware in downloads and brute-force login attempts, creating actionable alerts.  
* **Threat Intelligence:**  
  * **Hosts File Blocking:** Downloads and installs a master hosts file to block thousands of ad, malware, and tracking domains.  
  * **Browser History Scanner:** Scans Firefox and Chrome/Chromium history for visits to known malicious sites.  
* **System Updates:** A simple one-command option to update, upgrade, and clean your system packages.

#### **üïµÔ∏è Anonymity & Privacy**

* **VPN Management:** Start/stop OpenVPN connections and download configurations from a URL.  
* **VPN Kill Switch:** Instantly create a firewall kill switch that blocks all traffic if the VPN disconnects.  
* **Tor Integration:** An "Anonsurf"-style mode to route all system traffic through the Tor network for maximum anonymity.  
* **MAC Address Changer:** Randomize or reset your network card's MAC address to prevent tracking on local networks.

#### **üìä Monitoring & Reporting**

* **Live Monitoring Hub:** Open separate, dedicated terminal windows to watch live logs for the firewall, user logins, system events, and bot activity without interrupting your workflow.  
* **Security Reports:** Generate historical reports on firewall blocks, successful logins, and failed login attempts to identify patterns and potential threats.  
* **Automated CSV Reporting:** An optional bot that generates CSV reports of firewall blocks and failed logins every 5 minutes for easy analysis.  
* **Quick Status Dashboard:** An all-in-one dashboard showing your public IP, firewall status, pending updates, internet speed, disk usage, and more.

#### **‚öôÔ∏è System & User Management**

* **Full User Management:** A secure, multi-user login system. Admins can add, delete, and change the privilege level (user/admin) of other users.  
* **Bot Management System:** A dedicated menu for admins to create new scheduled bots (network scans, file scans), list all active bots, delete bots, and even edit the bot source code.  
* **Secure Backup & Restore:** Create an encrypted backup of all users and settings, which can be restored at any time.

### **Installation**

The script is designed to be self-contained and easy to set up.

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   git clone \[https://github.com/ghox789/NSA-Security-Toolkit.git\](https://github.com/ghox789/NSA-Security-Toolkit.git)

2. **Navigate into the directory:**  
   cd NSA-Security-Toolkit

3. **Make the script executable:**  
   chmod \+x nsa.sh

### **How to Use**

1. **Run the script:**  
   ./nsa.sh

2. **First-Time Setup:**  
   * The script will detect if it's the first time being run.  
   * It will check for all required software packages and ask for your permission to install any that are missing.  
   * It will then guide you through an initial setup for the firewall and antivirus database.  
   * Finally, it will prompt you to create the initial **admin** user account.  
3. **Login:** After the first run, you will always be greeted by a secure login prompt.  
4. **Navigate the Menus:** Simply use the number keys to navigate through the various tools and options.
